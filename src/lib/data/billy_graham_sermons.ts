### BILLY GRAHAM: CHRIST'S ANSWER TO THE WORLD
*(Based on the sermon delivered at Charlotte Crusade, 1958)*

**THE UNIVERSAL COMMAND: REPENT**
"And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent." (Acts 17:30, KJV)
God is not suggesting; He is commanding. The answer to the world's confusion, fear, and sin is a radical turning away from self and toward God.

**THE FACT OF JUDGMENT**
We face a day of reckoning. God "hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained" (Acts 17:31). This is not a scare tactic but a reality of the universe. Moral laws are as real as physical laws.

**THE ASSURANCE OF RESURRECTION**
"He hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead."
The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the guarantee of our own resurrection and judgment. It is the historical fact that anchors our faith.

**THE HUMAN CONDITION**
The world is filled with frustration, neuroses, and fear. Psychological and political solutions are insufficient because the root problem is spiritual: SIN. Alcohol, materialism, and escapism are merely symptoms of a soul trying to flee from God.

**THE SOLUTION**
The Cross of Christ. "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8). 
You must:
1. Acknowledge your sin.
2. Repent (turn around).
3. Receive Christ by faith.
