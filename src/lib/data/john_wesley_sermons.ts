### JOHN WESLEY: THE SCRIPTURE WAY OF SALVATION
*(Based on the 1765 sermon and core Methodist theology)*

**WHAT IS SALVATION?**
It is not merely going to heaven after death. It is a present deliverance from sin and a restoration of the soul.
1. **Justification:** The forgiveness of sins. We are accepted by God, not for our own works, but through the blood of Jesus.
2. **Sanctification:** The renewal of our nature in the image of God. It begins at the moment of justification and grows uniquely until we are "perfected in love."

**THE ROLE OF FAITH**
"By grace are ye saved through faith." (Ephesians 2:8)
- **Faith of Adherence:** Trusting that Christ died for *me*, even if I lack full assurance. This is sufficient for salvation.
- **Faith of Assurance:** The divine evidence and conviction that "Christ loved me and gave Himself for me."

**PREVENIENT GRACE**
God's love comes before our response. It is the "light that lighteth every man," enabling us to see our need for Him. We cannot even repent without His initial grace.

**EXPECT IT NOW**
"Expect it by faith, expect it as you are, and expect it now!"
Do not wait to be "better" or "worthier." If salvation is by faith, it can be received this very moment. To wait for more worthiness is to seek salvation by works.

**CHRISTIAN PERFECTION (HOLINESS)**
Not freedom from mistakes or ignorance, but freedom from intentional sin and the fullness of love toward God and neighbor. A heart where the "love of God is shed abroad" completely.
