### THE DEITY OF JESUS CHRIST (Moody Bible Institute Doctrine)

**FULLY GOD AND FULLY MAN**
Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, who took upon Himself human flesh, becoming fully man while remaining fully God. He is one person with two distinct natures, divine and human, freely united without confusion or division.

**EQUALITY WITH THE FATHER**
Jesus Christ is equal with God the Father and is to be worshipped as God. Scripture gives Him equal prominence with the Father in baptismal formulas and apostolic benedictions. 

"I and my Father are one." (John 10:30)

**DIVINE WORKS**
Jesus performs works that are exclusively attributable to God:
- **Creation:** "All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made." (John 1:3)
- **Sustaining:** He upholds all things by the word of His power. (Hebrews 1:3)
- **Forgiveness:** He has the authority to forgive sins, a prerogative belonging only to God. (Mark 2:5-10)
- **Life & Judgment:** He raises the dead and executes judgment upon all mankind. (John 5:21-22)

**HIS OWN CLAIMS**
Jesus explicitly claimed Deity:
- He instructed disciples to pray in His name.
- He identified Himself as the Son of God.
- He declared that knowing, seeing, believing in, and honoring Him is equivalent to knowing, seeing, believing in, and honoring the Father.
- "He that hateth me hateth my Father also." (John 15:23)

**THE TRIUNE GOD**
God is a triune being, eternally existing as three co-equal Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. These divine Persons possess the same eternal perfections and work harmoniously in creation, sustenance, and redemption.
