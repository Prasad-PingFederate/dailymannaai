### THE APOSTOLIC PREACHING (KERYGMA)
*Key Sermons and Doctrines from the Book of Acts and Epistles*

**ST. PAUL AT ANTIOCH (Acts 13)**
*The History of Salvation*
- **Fulfillment:** Jesus is the culmination of Israel's history and the fulfillment of the Davidic covenant.
- **Justification by Faith:** "By him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses." (Acts 13:39). The Law exposes sin; Christ removes it.

**ST. PAUL AT THE AREOPAGUS (Acts 17)**
*God the Creator and Judge*
- **The Unknown God Revealed:** He is not a localized deity but the Sovereign Creator of all nations. "In him we live, and move, and have our being."
- **Universal Brotherhood:** God "hath made of one blood all nations of men" (Acts 17:26). 
- **The Call to Repentance:** Ignorance is no longer an excuse. The proof of absolute judgment is the Resurrection of the Man, Jesus Christ.

**ST. PETER AT PENTECOST (Acts 2)**
*The Power of the Spirit*
- **The Pouring Out:** The Holy Spirit, promised by Joel, is now available to all—sons, daughters, young, and old.
- **The Kerygma:** Jesus, a man approved of God, was crucified by lawless hands but RAISED by God because "it was not possible that he should be holden of it" (Acts 2:24).
- **The Response:** "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." (Acts 2:38).

**THE APOSTOLIC CORE**
1. **The Resurrection is Central:** Without the rising of Jesus, faith is vain (1 Cor 15).
2. **Jesus is Lord (Kyrios):** He is not just Messiah but holds the divine name and authority of Yahweh.
3. **Salvation is by Grace:** It is a gift of God, not of works (Eph 2:8-9).
